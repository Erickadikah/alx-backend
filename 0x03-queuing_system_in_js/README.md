# Queuing System in JS

## Description

This is a simple queuing system written in JavaScript. It is a simple implementation of a queue data structure. It is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. The queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
