## Description
This repository contains some of my projects with internationalization and localization.

## Learning Objectives
- What Internationalization and Localization are
- What `gettext` is
- How to use `gettext` to create Python regular and QT `*.ts` files
- How to use `pybabel` to create `*.po` and `*.mo` files

## Requirements
- All files are created and executed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files are linted with `pycodestyle` using the [Holberton Betty style]() and checked with `PEP8` version 1.7
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is `#!/usr/bin/python3` exactly
- All files are executable
- The length of the files will be tested using `wc`
